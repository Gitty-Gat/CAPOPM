\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\sectionpurpose{This section summarizes the refactored manuscript contribution in one statement: PRISM is a coherent Bayesian workflow for event-probability inference from L3 order flow and calibrated ML signals.}

\sectionlearn{
\item What the paper now contributes.
\item What is supported versus still open.
\item Why the revised workflow is auditable end-to-end.
}

PRISM delivers a transparent probabilistic pipeline with explicit stage contracts, flat structural anchoring, calibrated ML uncertainty transport, and conjugate posterior outputs. The manuscript removes unsupported structural machinery and keeps theory aligned with the revised workflow.

Empirical evidence from current synthetic artifacts is mixed; therefore conclusions remain conservative. The contribution is a rigorous and auditable inference workflow, not a claim of universal empirical dominance.

\sectionestablished{
\item The paper now presents a coherent PRISM workflow with consistent notation and scope.
\item Theoretical and empirical claims are bounded to what the current artifacts support.
\item Main and supplement jointly provide reproducible documentation for further extension.
