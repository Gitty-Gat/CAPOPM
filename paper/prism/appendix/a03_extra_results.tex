\section{Additional Results Notes}
\label{app:extra-results}

This appendix records concise notes on artifact interpretation.

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Several scenario outputs include low-support and coverage-deviation flags. These flags are treated as first-order qualifiers, not secondary annotations.
\item Mixed determinate/indeterminate patterns within and across families indicate regime sensitivity and do not support unconditional family-level validation claims.
\item Where calibration fallback rules were triggered, posterior concentration is intentionally reduced to prevent overconfident inference.
\end{itemize}

For exact scenario-level values, refer to:
