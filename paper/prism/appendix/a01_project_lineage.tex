\section{Project Lineage}
\label{app:lineage}

This appendix records historical lineage only.

Earlier manuscript generations were written under the project name \textbf{CAPOPM}. Those drafts used phase-based organization and included structural machinery that is not part of the current canonical workflow. The present paper refactors that legacy into PRISM with a narrower and cleaner scope: posterior inference for event probabilities from L3 order flow and calibrated machine-learning signals.

Lineage notes:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
\item Legacy naming was replaced in the active manuscript with PRISM terminology.
\item Legacy phase framing was replaced by section-based workflow narrative.
\item Legacy structural components not required by the current workflow were removed from active text.
\item Original legacy sources are preserved unchanged in \texttt{paper/prism/\_legacy/} for audit trail.
\end{itemize}

This appendix is the only location in the active manuscript where the legacy acronym appears.
