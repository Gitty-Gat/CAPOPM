# Claim ↔ Audit Remap Table (Stage B.0)
Authority: CAPOPM.pdf > requirements.txt > claim_table.md. All mappings cite Stage A findings where misalignment occurred. Items marked UNKNOWN require explicit PDF index extraction before use in Stage B.1.

| Definition: Stage2 mixture offsets | Defines regime-specific offsets and weights (Phase 6) | Weight normalization; mixture mean computation | Entropy collapse claims | Finite-sample | Per-run regime weights; normalization checks; concentration trend only | Upstream audit `audit_investigation/UPSTREAM_PIPELINE_AUDIT.md:31-36` |
| All other Theorems/Propositions/Lemmas/Definitions in CAPOPM.pdf | UNKNOWN — full index not yet extracted; must be populated before use in audits or implementation decisions | UNKNOWN | Any proxy until defined | UNKNOWN | UNKNOWN | Requires PDF index extraction; not covered in Stage A |

## Enforcement Rules
- Only admissible proxies above may be used in audits or diagnostics; forbidden metrics must not be used for claim validation.
- Any claim not present in this table is untestable until the table is updated with a CAPOPM.pdf citation.
- Stage B.1 must realign audit_contracts and criteria to admissible proxies with required experimental design (grid coverage, n_runs, CI where specified).
